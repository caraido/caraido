Abstract:
Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that decode speech have largely decoded phonemes and relied on large language models to form those into words and sentences. Forming words and sentences requires proper grammar, including syntax, both on word (tense, grammatical number, person) and sentence (subject/object/verb order) levels. Despite the critical role of syntax in natural language processing, electrophysiological evidence for its representation in the brain remains limited. Evoked responses in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), particularly in pars triangularis, showed some modulation with tense processing. Imaging and lesion studies link IFG damage to deficits in syntax comprehension and agrammatism. However, the precise role of the IFG, especially pars opercularis, in syntactic processing remains unclear, including the specific type of processing involved and the extent of syntactic information represented at the neuronal scale. Decoding syntax directly from brain signals in the IFG could potentially improve BCIs by enabling more fluent and contextually appropriate sentence generation for individuals with impaired speech.
