  abstract={Negative afterimages are perceptual phenomena that occur after physical stimuli disappear from sight. Their origin is linked to transient post-stimulus responses of visual neurons. The receptive fields (RFs) of these subcortical ON- and OFF-center neurons exhibit antagonistic interactions between central and surrounding visual space, resulting in selectivity for stimulus polarity and size. These two features are closely intertwined, yet their relationship to negative afterimage perception remains unknown. Here we tested whether size differentially affects the perception of bright and dark negative afterimages in humans of both sexes, and how this correlates with neural mechanisms in subcortical ON and OFF cells. Psychophysically, we found a size-dependent asymmetry whereby dark disks produce stronger and longer-lasting negative afterimages than bright disks of equal contrast at sizes >0.8°. Neurophysiological recordings from retinal and relay cells in female cat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus showed that subcortical ON cells exhibited stronger sustained post-stimulus responses to dark disks, than OFF cells to bright disks, at sizes >1°. These sizes agree with the emergence of center-surround antagonism, revealing stronger suppression to opposite-polarity stimuli for OFF versus ON cells, particularly in dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. Using a network-based retino-geniculate model, we confirmed stronger antagonism and temporal transience for OFF-cell post-stimulus rebound responses. A V1 population model demonstrated that both strength and duration asymmetries can be propagated to downstream cortical areas. Our results demonstrate how size-dependent antagonism impacts both the neuronal post-stimulus response and the resulting afterimage percepts, thereby supporting the idea of perceptual RFs reflecting the underlying neuronal RF organization of single cells.}

  abstract={Objective. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that decode speech from neural activity have the potential to restore communication in people with paralysis. Most prior work has focused on decoding speech from the motor cortex, but other cortical areas may also contain useful information about speech intent. Here, we investigate the feasibility of decoding speech from non-frontal cortical areas, including the temporal and parietal lobes. Approach. We recorded electrocorticography (ECoG) signals from 10 human participants undergoing neurosurgery while they performed a word repetition task. We trained machine learning models to decode spoken words from neural activity in non-frontal cortical areas and compared performance to models trained on frontal areas. Main results. We found that speech could be decoded from non-frontal cortical areas with accuracy significantly above chance, although performance was lower than that achieved using frontal areas. Combining signals from both frontal and non-frontal areas improved decoding accuracy compared to using either area alone. Significance. Our results demonstrate that non-frontal cortical areas contain information about speech intent that can be leveraged for BCI applications. Incorporating signals from multiple cortical regions may enhance the performance of speech BCIs and provide more robust communication options for individuals with paralysis.},

  abstract={Recognizing conspecifics—others of the same species—in order to determine how to interact with them appropriately is a fundamental goal of animal sensory systems. It has undergone selective pressure in nearly all species. Mice have a large repertoire of social behaviors that are the subject of a rapidly growing field of study in neuroscience. Mouse social interactions likely incorporate all available sensory modalities, and the vast majority of studies have not attempted to isolate them. Our understanding of the role of vision in mouse social interactions remains overlooked, given the prominence of olfactory research in this area. To address this, we developed a behavioral platform that allowed us to present a subject mouse with the visual information of stimulus mice in isolation from olfactory, acoustic, and tactile cues. Our results indicate that the visual identification of the sex or individual identity of other mice influences behavior. These findings highlight the underappreciated role of vision in mouse social interactions and open new avenues to study the visual circuits underlying social behavior.},

  abstract={The relationship between intracortical spiking activity and high gamma activity (HGA, 70-200 Hz) is complex and not fully understood. While HGA is often used as a proxy for local neuronal firing rates, recent studies have shown that HGA can be modulated independently of spiking activity. In this study, we investigated the dissociation between intracortical spiking and HGA in the motor cortex of non-human primates during a reaching task. We found that while both spiking activity and HGA increased during movement, there were instances where HGA was elevated without a corresponding increase in spiking activity. This dissociation was particularly evident during periods of sustained muscle contraction, suggesting that HGA may reflect synaptic inputs or subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations rather than direct neuronal firing. Our findings highlight the need for caution when interpreting HGA as a direct measure of neuronal activity and suggest that HGA may provide complementary information about cortical processing that is not captured by spiking activity alone.}
