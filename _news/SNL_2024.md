Our [published paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-51839-z) and ongoing work on syntax representation in human language network were presented at the 2024 Society for the Neurobiology of Language (SNL) Conference in Brisbane, Australia.

Our study shows that brain sites which, when stimulated, cause language errors tend to act as “connector nodes” between subnetworks in the language network—i.e. they’re not densely connected locally or globally, but bridge different communities—whereas sites causing speech arrest don’t show that connector signature. That means understanding how a cortical site is connected (network‐topology), not just where it is or how active it is, can better predict its importance for language, which could improve surgical mapping and our general models of how language is organized in the brain.

The ongoing work on syntax representation in human brain highlights that syntax—the rules for combining words into meaningful sentences—is directly represented in neuronal activity in the inferior frontal gyrus, especially the pars opercularis, filling a long-standing gap in electrophysiological evidence. By showing syntax can be decoded at the neural level, it points toward next-generation speech BCIs that could move beyond phoneme decoding to generate fluent, grammatically correct sentences.

Both findings combined show that **language isn’t just about where activity happens in the brain, but how regions are wired and represent structure**—whether that’s connector hubs in the network that make speech possible, or neural population coding in the IFG that capture syntax. The broader takeaway is that _mapping the organization and representations of language at the network scale_ is key for both basic neuroscience and building BCIs that move beyond sound decoding toward fluent, grammatically intact speech.
