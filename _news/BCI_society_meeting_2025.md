Our lab presented our ongoing work at the 2025 BCI Meeting in Banff, Canada.
Alec presented his work on "Aspects of speech production represented in inferior frontal gyrus" as a poster and his colleague [Prashanth Prakash](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=REpr1JsAAAAJ&hl=en) presented their work on phoneme decoding from inferior frontal gyrus as a talk. These works highlight the role of inferior frontal gyrus in speech production and its potential for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that restore communication for individuals with impaired speech.
