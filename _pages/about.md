Hi there! I’m Alec, a PhD candidate in Neuroscience at Northwestern University. I’m fortunate to be co-advised by two incredible PIs ([Dr. Marc Slutzky](https://sites.northwestern.edu/slutzkylab/) and [Dr. Joshua Glaser](https://glaserlab.github.io/research/)) at Northwestern, where we explore the intersection of neuroscience and AI—developing machine learning models that bring us closer to building next-generation brain–computer and neuromotor interfaces.

My primary focus is on decoding language and speech from high-dimensional intracranial neural recordings, combining statistical modeling and deep learning to reveal how the brain processes word level semantics, syntax, and phonemes. In parallel, I study large language models like Wav2Vec2.0 and HuBERT, uncovering how human-like perceptual biases—such as the lexical bias in phoneme categorization—emerge in purely feedforward architectures. Together, these dual tracks let me compare brain signals and AI models side-by-side, offering insights into both human cognition and artificial systems.

Beyond my main projects, I’ve also worked on
- [1] video-based pipelines to classify stages of Parkinson’s disease from human movement.
- [2] improved clinical assessment for stroke patients during arm reaching with IMU and video recordings.
- [3] designed neurofeedback paradigms to probe the dissociation between spikes and high-gamma signals for BCIs.
- [4] built unsupervised models to cluster animal behavior into interpretable motifs.

Together, these projects reflect my broader goal: combining modern AI technology and neuroscience knowledge to build state-of-art health products for human wellbeing.
