My work on [Active Dissociation of Intracortical Spiking and High-Gamma Activity](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.07.10.663559) was presented at the 2023 Society for Neuroscience (SfN) Conference in Washington, D.C.
This study investigates the relationship between intracortical spiking activity and high-gamma activity (HGA) in the monkey brain, particularly in the context of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). While HGA is often used as a proxy for neuronal firing rates in BCIs, this research demonstrates that HGA can be modulated independently of spiking activity through neurofeedback. Monkeys were able to learn to control HGA without corresponding changes in spiking activity, suggesting that HGA reflects more than just local neuronal firing. This finding has significant implications for the design and interpretation of BCIs, indicating that relying solely on HGA may not provide a complete picture of neural activity.
